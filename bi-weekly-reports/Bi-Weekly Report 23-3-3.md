### 2. Progress Report

- **Java Project (20% finished): **Have written several useful Class like Message and User. Half-finished the code of Client Class. Have designed the GUI for the Login Page.
- **Python Project (0% finished): **Have not started yet 

### 3. Works finished in the past two weeks

Learning knowledge about Multi-Thread. Learning knowledge about Socket and use it to build connection between Server and Client. Learning knowledge about Swing and use it to design a UI for the login page as a practice.

After learning all these knowledge, I found my original imagination of how to write these codes of ChatRoom is wrong. They just don't work that way. So I re-designed the structure of my ChatRoom codes.

I break down the single source code file written in the first two weeks into several Java file and make them a real "Project". I re-write some of these old codes. And I have written some part of the Client and the Server using the socket and multi-thread. 

### 4. Works to be done in the following two weeks

Complete the rest of Client Class and Server Class which have all the basic functions. Design and implement  a GUI for my ChatRoom.
